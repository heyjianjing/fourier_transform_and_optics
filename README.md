# fourier transform and optics (and other applications)

### Notes on fourier transform (`ft`) (largely based on lectures from Prof. Brad Osgood of Stanford)

`ft_01`
* Analysis and synthesis of period function
* Fourier series
* Inner product between functions
* Complex exponential as orthonormal basis for functions

### Notes on geometric optics (`go`) and wave optics (`wo`) (largely based on lectures from Sander Konijnenberg, currently with ASML)

`go_01`
* Convex and concave lens
* Real and virtual image

`go_02`
* Reflection
* Refraction and Snell's law

`go_03`
* Free space propagation
* Single thin lens propagation
* Paraxial approximation
* Transfer matrix
* Imaging condition

`go_04`
* Magnification factor
* Magnifier
* Microscope
* Telescope

`go_05`
* Chief ray and marginal ray
* Aperture
* Depth of focus
