# fourier transform and optics (and other applications)

Notes on fourier transform (`ft`) (largely based on lectures from Prof. Brad Osgood of Stanford)

`ft_01`
* Analysis and synthesis of period function
* Fourier series
* Inner product between functions
* Complex exponential as orthonormal basis for functions

Notes on geometric optics (`go`) and wave optics (`wo`) (largely based on lectures from Sander Konijnenberg, currently with ASML)
